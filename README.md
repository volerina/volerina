I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich working on speech and voice processing using behavioural and neuroscience methods. 

I also work as a forensic speech and audio analyst at [JP French International](https://www.jpfrench.com/valeriia-perepelytsia-4/). I am involved in cases with forensic speaker comparison, transcription and enhancement.
