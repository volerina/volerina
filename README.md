I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Linguistic Research Infrastructure (LiRI), University of Zurich. I work on speech and voice processing using behavioural and neuroscience methods. I am also a forensic consultant at [JP French International] (https://www.jpfrench.com/) and managing editor at the [LINGUIST List] (https://linguistlist.org/).
