I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Linguistic Research Infrastructure ([LiRI](https://www.liri.uzh.ch/en.html)), University of Zurich. I work on speech and voice processing using behavioural and neuroscience methods. I am also a forensic consultant at [JP French International](https://www.jpfrench.com/) and managing editor at the [LINGUIST List](https://linguistlist.org/).
